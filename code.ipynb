They have the expertise to put tools to use to build great products. But the journey of a product from manufacturing to market is a tough and mostly fatal one. The most significant cause of startup failure is lack of customers. Or more importantly, a lack of listening to customers!\\nThis workshop is designed to address this phase of your startup journey. And startups may often revisit this exercise every time they assess the startup health. It is relevant to startups at all stages and all sizes. This workshop will help participants gain insight into deriving value proposition through customer feedback in a fun and exciting way.\\nAs a startup looking at moving forward with your idea or product towards leadership in the market, this boot camp will be a fundamental activity to understand and systemize listening to the Voice of the Customer. SRiX incubatee startups will be participating in the program, and it will be an excellent opportunity for you to interact with the coaches and mentors available during the event.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBACK TO EVENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdmissions\\nAdmissions\\n\\n\\nAdmission\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFee & Scholarship\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Links:\\n\\n\\nOther Links\\n\\n\\nCompetitive Exam\\n\\n\\nNewsletter\\n\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n\\nCommittees \\n\\n\\nCentral Library \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0 \\n\\n\\nInternational  Affairs \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAC-Holidays List\\n\\n\\nExam Branch\\n\\n\\nEvents\\n\\n\\nGrievance \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMedia\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n RTI \\n\\n\\nNews\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUGC\\n\\n\\nNIRF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuick Connects\\n\\n\\nQuick Connects\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Payment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVisit Us \\nAcademics \\nCampus life \\nAdmissions\\nExam Branch\\n\\n\\nAC-Holidays List\\nCareers\\nUGC\\nNIRF\\nCentral Library  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Payment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSR UNIVERSITY\\nAnanthasagar, Hasanparthy\\nHanumakonda 506371, Telangana, India\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0(870) 281-8333/8311\\ninfo@sru.edu.in\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Subscribe News Letters\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Quick Connects\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n © 2024, SR University.

We know that discovery and experimentation includes making mistakes, but so often trial and error aren’t a part of our modern classroom. Colleges often miss teaching the value of problem solving, and students are inadvertently taught to internalize failure. That’s what Tinker Camp is all about. It helps students find the joy in success and failure, and hopefully in the process of creating a life-long love for problem-solving and experimentation. At Tinker camp, Students from different disciplines are chosen to work together to complete a hands-on project. The camp helps different engineering students to know the role of other disciplines in completing a project. Campers will also know how engineering can change human living conditions. Tinker Camp is organized for engineering and management students every year.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBACK TO EVENTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdmissions\\nAdmissions\\n\\n\\nAdmission\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFee & Scholarship\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Links:\\n\\n\\nOther Links\\n\\n\\nCompetitive Exam\\n\\n\\nNewsletter\\n\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n\\nCommittees \\n\\n\\nCentral Library \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\xa0 \\n\\n\\nInternational  Affairs \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAC-Holidays List\\n\\n\\nExam Branch\\n\\n\\nEvents\\n\\n\\nGrievance \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMedia\\n \\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n RTI \\n\\n\\nNews\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUGC\\n\\n\\nNIRF\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuick Connects\\n\\n\\nQuick Connects\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Payment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVisit Us \\nAcademics \\nCampus life \\nAdmissions\\nExam Branch\\n\\n\\nAC-Holidays List\\nCareers\\nUGC\\nNIRF\\nCentral Library  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Payment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSR UNIVERSITY\\nAnanthasagar, Hasanparthy\\nHanumakonda 506371, Telangana, India\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n0(870) 281-8333/8311\\ninfo@sru.edu.in\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Subscribe News Letters\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Quick Connects\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n © 2024, SR University.

Do you aspire to be the difference maker? Do you want to solve problems through unique value propositions and generate revenue? B- Spark, a B Plan Pitching Competition, is the platform you are looking for.\\nNature is an infinite treasure of miracles. The beauty of nature has influenced designs ranging from that of an airplane to everyday things. One such miraculous action occurring in nature is the transformation of an Idea into a Business. Make in SREC has adopted the same model for entrepreneurial engagement of students. Participation in Make 'n' Market allows students to develop the spark of entrepreneurship.\\nMake 'n' Market is followed by other initiatives of Make in SREC, which inculcate entrepreneurial mindset. This stage is for Idea to Business Plan transformation, where the critical growth of the business takes place. B-Spark competition serves as a unique platform for the evaluation, iteration, and starting up of business ideas.

How many of those ideas might have been the key that the world needed? No one is born without a dream. But everyone isn’t fortunate enough to complete their dreams, due to myriad reasons. Being part of a country with extraordinarily talented minds, it’s only useful if they are directed in the right path. You live in a world where opportunities are rarely offered. “Don’t wait for an opportunity. Grab it or create your own” If you have a dream, then you should do everything to carve it into reality. Make in SREC is here with one such opportunity for all young inspiring and upcoming minds - “Make 'n' Market”.\\nMake 'n' Market have been a gateway for thousands of minds to an entrepreneurial experience not only for SREC but also for the minds from the other colleges.

COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (BIG DATA AND DATA ANALYTICS )\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview\\nBig data analytics is the implementation of advanced analytic techniques against very large, diverse data sets that include structured, semi-structured and unstructured data, from different sources, and in varied sizes from terabytes to zettabytes.\\n\\nWith the advance of IT storage, processing, computation, and sensing technologies, Big Data has become a novel norm of life. Big data is a term applied to data sets whose size or type is beyond the processing scope of traditional relational databases to capture, manage and process the data with low latency. Artificial intelligence (AI), mobile, social and the Internet of Things (IoT) are driving data complexity through new forms and sources of data. Big data comes from sensors, devices, video/audio, networks, log files, transactional applications, web, and social media — much of it generated in real time and at a very large scale now a days.

EMBEDDED SYSTEMS\\xa0(In partnership with Arm)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOverview\\nEMBEDDED SYSTEMS is an exciting, challenging and growing field which will spread through industry in future.  With the advent of industrial automation, microcontrollers and applications have been around since the 1960’s in all manufacturing organizations, including chemical plants, automobile manufacturing units, nuclear plants, energy generation units, and the like. Every industrial sector viz., telecommunications, banking, health care, avionics, automobile, food processing, semiconductor electronics, defence etc., all use embedded systems to monitor and control the plants remotely.  It should not be surprising that nearly 90 percent of the automation and applications end up in embedded systems.\\n\\nEmbedded systems and IoT are gaining importance in all aspects of engineering. It is expected that in the near future, no gadget will exist without software and embedded technology. IoT is connecting gadgets (things) through the internet and cloud. IoT is being implemented everywhere like in smart cities, security, smart agriculture and home automation. This has created a lot of buzz among industries and right now all the companies are looking for candidates who have practical experience with IoT. A Research and Advisory company predicted that 8.4 billion connected devices will be in use worldwide in 2017 and will reach 20.4 billion by 2020. In India alone, more than 1000 tech start-ups are engaged in IoT based projects, offering plenty of job opportunities.\\n\\nKnowing the importance of such technologies, M.Tech (Embedded Systems) is launched in partnership with Arm, which is rapidly advancing IoT technologies through the design and development of the integral platforms, sensors, and subsystems that drive IoT performance. The courses of the program are designed with the involvement of industry partner Armto ensure that they match the global job market demand and reflect the current state of industry research areas. This collaboration facilitates knowledge sharing between both the organizations and improves students’ knowledge and skills in the aforementioned areas.\\n\\nThe students of the program will have an opportunity to work as iScholars at the Center for Embedded and IoT Systems (EIoT) which helps to gain hands-on experience and become industry-ready. The Center offers mini-projects, internship programs and projects in collaboration with Industries. A student can also explore other interdisciplinary research centers@SRU\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProgram  &\\nits Features\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEligibility\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFee & Scholarship\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSyllabus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis program provides a broad coverage of challenges and research issues to the design and management of automation.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe students are exposed to advanced courses such as IOT protocols, embedded system design, computing, kernel programming, software defined radio and many more.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe curriculum prepares students to take on complex challenges in the real world.

We know that discovery and experimentation includes making mistakes, but so often trial and error aren’t a part of our modern classroom. Colleges often miss teaching the value of problem solving, and students are inadvertently taught to internalize failure. That’s what Tinker Camp is all about. It helps students find the joy in success and failure, and hopefully in the process of creating a life-long love for problem-solving and experimentation. At Tinker camp, Students from different disciplines are chosen to work together to complete a hands-on project. The camp helps different engineering students to know the role of other disciplines in completing a project. Campers will also know how engineering can change human living conditions. Tinker Camp is organized for engineering and management students every year.
