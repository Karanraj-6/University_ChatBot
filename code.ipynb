In \\nthese customized programs, students seamlessly transfer to the pa rtner university during their final \\nyear (7th or 8th Semester) to obtain a bachelor ’s degree from SRU and a master ’s degree from the \\npartner institution. The distinct advantage lies in students com-pleting their programs ahead of their \\npeers, leading to bo th time and financial savings. Notably, these programs often waive GRE/TOEFL \\nrequirements, streamlining the application process. The beauty of this arrangement extends to post-\\nstudy work rights, as participating in these Master ’s Programs does not compromi se the ability to \\npursue employment in the host country. This innovative approach not only accelerates academic \\nachievement but also enhances the overall value of the educational experience for SRU students.

Self -plagiarism, a form of plagiarism, can also be \\ncommitted by reusing one’s own work which is publishe d in a source without proper citation to that \\nsource. It is considered plagiarism in educational content to use someone else’s idea or phrase without \\nproperly attributing the source of the work. It makes no difference if the source is an accomplished \\nwriter, another pupil, a web page without distinguished authorship, a website that sells research \\npapers, or anyone else as well: Whether done knowingly or unintentionally, claiming credit for \\nsomeone else’s work is considered as a form of academic theft and is  despicable in all educational \\nenvironments. Forms of plagiarism Verbatim: Quotations must be marked with quotation marks or \\nindentation and fully cited. The reader must know which parts are your own and which are borrowed. \\nCut and paste: This type is defined when a person copy and paste the content from sources including \\ninternet, the list of sources must include references to Internet -derived information.
